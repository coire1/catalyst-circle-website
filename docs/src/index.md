# Catalyst Circle

a “human sensor array” acting as the representative body for all the different groups participating in Project Catalyst.
:::

::: slot description
The Circle that monitors the current state and future plans regarding governance in Catalyst. It detects and discusses concerns, objections and opportunities arising within the Catalyst ecosystem.


The Circle exists to fulfill four key goals:
- To facilitate communication between the different functional groups
- To provide a heads-up when red lines are crossed within a certain group
- To suggest improvements on plans and processes that shape Project Catalyst
- To define the election process for Circle V2
